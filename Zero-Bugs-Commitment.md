# The Zero Bugs Commitment

This project adheres to the **Zero Bugs Commitment** (`#ZeroBugs`).
This is a commitment to engage in *responsible software engineering* and
*proactive community participation*, with a goal of keeping the count of
open or known bugs at zero. It is also a commitment of *positive community
engagement*.

## 1. We will prioritize fixing bugs over implementing new features.

It is human nature to be much more interested in building new things than doing
the hard work to fix old, broken things.

*We pledge, wherever reasonable, to prioritize fixing known bugs above
implementing new features, with the goal of **keeping the count of open or known
bugs at zero**.*

## 2. We will take responsibility for code we have written or contributed to.

As attention shifts between projects, it is difficult to return to work on old
code. This can lead to bit rot.

*We pledge to take long-term responsibility for any significant code we create
or contribute to, fixing problems and updating code as necessary to prevent bit
rot. If we can no longer fulfill this responsibility, we will find someone else
who can take over.* 

Note that this is about taking *personal responsibility* for our own work, not
about who has the *official maintainership mantle* for a project or piece of
code we have contributed to.

## 3. We will be responsive during the bugfixing process

It is easy to delay responding to a bug report or a request until the bug or
request becomes forgotten or obsolete. This is the unfortunate state of the vast
majority of bug reports across the entire open source ecosystem. 

*We pledge to always be as responsive as we can reasonably be to any bug report
or request we receive, whether in our own bug tracker or the bug tracker of
another project.* 

## 4. We will be respectful and inclusive

Open source bug trackers have long been used to complain about pet issues,
and/or make demands that are not in line with the developers' priorities.
Developers of a codebase have been known to push back against these demands
by closing bugs as `#WONTFIX` without trying to understand the core issues,
or trying to find a compromise or solution. Maintainers have also been known
to reject the earnest but halting efforts of new contributors.

*We pledge to cultivate contributions and growth among our community by
striving to always listen to the needs and requests of community members,
by trying to find a good solution or middle ground when there is a disagreement,
and by welcoming, encouraging, and helping users who offer contributions.*
