# The Zero Bugs Commitment

This project adheres to the **Zero Bugs Commitment** (`#ZeroBugs`).
This is a commitment to practice *responsible software engineering*,
*proactive community participation*, and *positive community engagement*,
with a goal of keeping the count of known or open bugs at zero, while
respecting and cultivating community participation.

**As developers of this project, we pledge that:**

## 1. We will prioritize fixing bugs over implementing new features.

It is human nature to be much more interested in building new things than doing
the hard work to fix old, broken things.

| *We pledge, wherever reasonable, to prioritize fixing known bugs above
implementing new features, with the goal of **keeping the count of known or open
bugs at zero**.* |
|-|


## 2. We will take responsibility for code we have written or contributed to.

As attention shifts between projects, it is difficult to return to work on old
code. This can lead to bit rot.

| *We pledge to take long-term responsibility for any significant code we create
or contribute to, fixing problems and updating code as necessary to prevent bit
rot. If we can no longer fulfill this responsibility, we will find someone else
who can assume the responsibility for our code.* |
|-| 

Note that this is about taking *personal responsibility* for our own work, not
about who has *official maintainership* for a project or piece of code.

## 3. We will be responsive during the bugfixing process

It is easy to delay responding to a bug report or a request until the bug or
request becomes forgotten or obsolete. This is the unfortunate state of the vast
majority of bug reports across the entire open source ecosystem. 

| *We pledge to endeavor to be responsive to any bug report or request we
receive, whether in our own bug tracker or the bug tracker of another
project.* | 
|-|

## 4. We will be respectful and inclusive

Open source bug trackers are full of pet complaints and bugs closed as
`#WONTFIX`, without a significant attempt to understand core issues,
or to find a solution or compromise. Some development communities have
been known to reject earnest but halting efforts of new contributors.

| *We pledge to cultivate contributions and growth among our community by
striving to always listen to the needs and requests of community members;
by trying to find a good solution or middle ground when there is a disagreement;
and by welcoming, encouraging, and helping users who offer contributions.* |
