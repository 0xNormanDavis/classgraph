This directory contains ClassLoaderHandlers that are loaded via the ServiceLoader mechanism.
ClassLoaderHandlers are used to extract classpath elements from a ClassLoader.

You can register your own custom ClassLoaderHandler with FastClasspathScanner by calling
FastClasspathScanner#registerClassLoaderHandler() before calling #scan().

Note that URLClassLoader subclasses do not need a custom ClassLoaderHandler, they are
handled automatically by FastClasspathScanner.
