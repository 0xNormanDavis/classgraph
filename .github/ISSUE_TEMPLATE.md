<!---
When filing a new bug, please call `ClassGraph#verbose()` before
`ClassGraph#scan()`, and attach the generated verbose log to your
bug report. (You can attach log files by dragging and dropping
onto the GitHub issue editing pane.)

If possible, please create and attach a minimal, self-contained
testcase project that is able to trigger the bug. Bugfixes in the
form of pull requests are also very welcome.

Every attempt is made to be extremely responsive in fixing bugs
in ClassGraph, in contrast to many open source projects. However,
GitHub notifications are disabled by default for some users.
Please check your own GitHub notification settings to ensure that
you will be notified of comments and questions posted in response
to this bug report, so that the bug can be resolved quickly.

Thank you!
